## 📝 Project Summary
The Hiking Challenge Tracker allows hikers to more easily keep track of which mountains they have completed within their challenges in a simple and visual way. The database is pre-populated with stats on each hike, and hikers can add in their personal information such as the date, who they hiked with, and any notes they had when they log their hike. Hikers can view their progress using the pie-charts and graphically represented list of completed mountains per hiking challenge. Hikers can also edit their hiking information if need be.

## 🧑 User story:

<!-- 
![My Image](/src/images/submit-form.png)

Once you submit the new mountain, you will then see the corresponding pie chart update and give a visual representation of how many mountains you have completed, and also how many mountains are remaining to complete the challenge. From there you have the ability to click into each challenge - which will be indicated by a highlighted title - and it will diplay all completed mountains for that challenge below.

From here you are able to click on any of these mountains, and it will bring you to a new page where the selected moutain info - as well as your form information from the hike will be displayed and also editable. This way if you would like to update notes, or correct an error you made on the submission you can do it right from this page.

Once done viewing, you can press back - or if you made any edits to the form - then hit the "Submit Edits" button and you will get an alert in the window once the moutain is updated. when you click "OK" on the alert you will then be redirected back to the home page where you can begin to create new submissions or review other challenges.

this app is built by <b>Allie Soldau</b> and <b>Kevin Dutzy</b> using react, we created our own database with all the mountains and information. we also did all the CSS which are in box index.css and app.css. We are very satisfied with how this turned out and plan to add updates and refine it over the coming months to turn it into a fully functional app with a login, ways to add new challenges, and other features that everyone can use and enjoy.
